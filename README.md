# library
I think i finished this project now. The end was really tough with the delete and change status options.
I was not familiar with foreach loops and data attributes so i tried to di everything through the array
but it wasn't the best option in the long run. So i had to adjust my code late in the running and it was hard
to remove funcitionnality that i had already achieved to make everything easier in the end.<br>
Still the project was super cool and it's the first really complete one from the course i think.
We use a lot of things that we already learned and it makes the html css and js really work together.<br>
I think i still have some debugging to do and i may add other functionnality later on but for now i want to
move on with the course and i know we are going back on this project later so we'll see then.

## Update 1
Redesigned code around a Book class, this is so much better now, i feel like i can read through this super easily.
